# Introduction

Welcome to Clean Slate! The VSCode extension that allows you to create the files seen below. 

The extension currently supports (C#) and Unity based projects. Clean Slate will create the Markdown Documents for you, and you just have to update your index!

This page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate) and [CleanSlate](https://github.com/Liftlock/CleanSlate).
